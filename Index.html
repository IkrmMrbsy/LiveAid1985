                <br>
                <p class="article-paragraph">Live Aid was a colossal rock music event held on July 13, 1985. Bob Geldof
                    and Midge Ure organized the event to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. Concerts were held
                    simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London (attended by about 72,000 people) and JFK Stadium in
                    Philadelphia (attended by about 90,000 people). In addition, additional concerts were held in cities
                    such as Sydney and Moscow. The Live Aid concert went down in history as the largest live broadcast
                    in television history, with an estimated 1.9 billion viewers in 150 countries watching the event
                    live on television.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Live Aid show plan was born following Band Aid's success with the single "Do They Know It's
                    Christmas?". The Live Aid show was organized as a large-scale concert in two cities separated by the
                    Atlantic Ocean, London and Philadelphia. The success of this charity concert exceeded the
                    expectations of the organizers at that time. In a 2001 television program, Harvey Goldsmith, the
                    promoter of the Live Aid show, admitted that the concert was originally only expected to raise 1
                    million pounds (US$1.89 million),[1] but eventually raised 150 million pounds (US$283.6 million).
                    Bob Geldof was knighted by the British Empire, in part for organizing the Live Aid concert.

                <p class="article-content">The concert was opened by Status Quo with "Rockin' All Over the World".

                    The Queen group who performed "Bohemian Rhapsody" was greeted by the audience, and continued by the
                    masses singing and clapping together with Freddie Mercury in the song "Radio Ga Ga". The crowd
                    eagerly sang verse after verse of "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions" until the
                    performance seemed to be controlled by the crowd who took over the role of vocalist Freddie Mercury.
                    According to recent polls, Queen's performance is considered the best part of the Live Aid concert."

                <p class="article-content">Bob Geldof, when inviting artists to the Live Aid concert, promised that
                    their performances would be televised only, without being recorded. ABC Television footage of the
                    concert was deleted at Geldof's request, and a copy donated to the Smithsonian Institution is
                    presumed lost. MTV kept some footage, but commercial cuts and host commentary detracted from the
                    completeness of the footage. BBC television also did not delete footage, but does not have some
                    footage from the Philadelphia performance as it never aired it.

                            They performed "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "Bad," with a memorable performance. To top it
                            off, Bono jumped into the audience to help a drowning woman, creating an iconic moment in
                            concert history. U2's performance at Live Aid helped popularize the group globally and
